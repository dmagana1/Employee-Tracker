## Issues
So I ran into a snag. I am not sure why my program is not working. When I first ran the program to tested it out before recording with screencast it was working. Then I turned on screencast and my program an error popped up saying that I dont have a "Start." So I added a start to my Package.json, thinking that is would help, but when I started the program is only shows a list of the option the user can choose, but it doenst allow you choose any of the options.
